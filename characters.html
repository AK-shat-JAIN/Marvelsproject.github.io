              Norton and subsequently by Mark Ruffalo—based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name—known commonly by his alter

              bpm or when facing mortal danger. As the Hulk, he possesses superhuman abilities including increased strength and 
              durability. Over time, Banner demonstrates an increasing ability to control the transformation, and he becomes a founding 
              member of the Avengers. Following the conflict with Ultron, Banner is unintentionally transported to Sakaar, where he 
              remains the Hulk for a number of years until eventually returning to Earth to participate in the battle against Thanos. 
              In the years after Thanos erases half of all life, Banner learns to retain the Hulk form with his mind still intact, and 
              he is instrumental in the Avengers' mission to use time travel to obtain the Infinity Stones from the past. After the 
              Avengers succeed, Banner himself restores trillions of lives across the universe using the Stones in a specially made

              Gamora is a fictional character portrayed primarily by Zoe Saldaña in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) media franchise, 
              based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name. Gamora is depicted as a member of the Guardians of the Galaxy, 
              having escaped her previous life as an assassin after she was forcibly adopted by Thanos after he eliminated half of her 
              planet's race, including her mother. For the next twenty years, she served Thanos as a cybernetically enhanced warrior, 
              until betraying him to join the Guardians.[5] She becomes romantically involved with Peter Quill, and develops a positive 
              relationship with her adopted sister Nebula despite their rivalrous upbringing. She is eventually killed by Thanos when he 
              sacrifices her on Vormir to obtain the Soul Stone. When the Avengers use time travel in an effort to undo Thanos' actions, 
              an alternate 2014-Gamora accompanies 2014-Thanos to confront the Avengers in 2023 after he hijacks their technology. However
              , she switches sides and joins the fight against her father, but disappears after his defeat.
